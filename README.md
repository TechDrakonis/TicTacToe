## IDEA
The idea of this project was to create an terminal based TicTacToe application
written in C++ to show the usage of the c++s50 library in an actual project.
But it also had educational reasons i.e. to understand C++ logics better.

## Installation-Guide
Download the ideal package for your system [Linux user: .tar.gz; Windows users:
 .zip], unpack it, open the terminal and build the application from source.

> You can use cmake or build it with the needed files yourself
>> needed files: TicTacToe.cpp c++s50.hpp
